# Introduction ðŸ‘‹
Hi! Welcome to my Behance Projects repository!

In hopes to build and refine my skills in ReactJS with various Javascript libraries, I started this repo to reach out to different designers on Behance and build a version here on this repo. 

This project currently uses Vite ReactJS, and is extremely easy to start up.

## Starting Up ðŸš€

1. Clone this repo to your desktop
```

```

2. Navigate inside the project folder
```
cd behance-projects
```

3. Install the node modules
```
npm i
```

4. Start up the project in development mode
```
npm run dev
```

Here are some libraries used to build this project and the various pages:

- Feather Icons
- Framer Motion
